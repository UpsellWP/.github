**Best WooCommerce Upsell & Cross Sell strategies**

1. **Checkout Upsell - Displayed at the checkout page:**

  This is an effective Upselling strategy where an upsell offer is displayed on the checkout page before the customer places an order.

  Store owners can show attractive and relevant upsell offers to customers on the checkout page, encourage them to quickly add more items to their cart, and increase the average order value.

  **Example,**
    * When a customer purchases an iPhone, you can offer an iPhone cover at 30% off.
    * When a customer adds a T-Shirt to their cart, you can show an order bump, suggesting sunglasses with a 50% discount that goes well with the T-Shirt.

2. **Post-Purchase Upsell - Displayed after the purchase but before the thank you page:**

  With this Upsell offer, you can show additional products to customers immediately after their checkout process.

  You can prioritize and show relevant products based on your customer behavior and encourage customers to make additional purchases in your store. Customers can buy the Upsell offer with just one click, it will be added instantly to the order.

  This is a great marketing strategy to improve customer engagement, encourage customers to make repeat purchases, and increase the store's revenue.

  **Example,**
    * When a customer purchases a Mobile phone, after placing the order, you can suggest a charger with a $10 Fixed discount as an upsell offer after checkout.

3. **Frequently Bought Together - Displayed at the product page**

  This is another popular Upselling strategy.
  The customers are presented with products that are often purchased in combination with the item currently viewed or added to their cart. These offers work by analyzing past customer purchases and using that data to suggest complementary products.

  Examples of "Frequently Bought Together" offers could be:
  * A laptop, a laptop case, and a wireless mouse.
  * A novel, a bookmark, and a book light.
  * A yoga mat, yoga blocks, and a yoga mat cleaner.

4. **Cart Upsell - Displayed at the cart page**

  The Cart Upsells feature is a powerful tool designed to increase the average order value by recommending complementary or higher value products to customers at the crucial point of checkout.

  For example, if a customer is purchasing a digital camera, the plugin might suggest buying an extra memory card, a carrying case, or even a higher-end camera that includes additional features.

  Examples of "Cart Upsell" offers could be:
  * A Gift Wrap add-on
  * When customer purchases a T-shirt, recommend matching accessories such as jewelry, shoes, or a handbag.

5. **Double the order - Displayed at the checkout page**

  The "Double the Order" feature acts as an effective strategy to boost sales by encouraging customers to double their current order with just one click, often with a discount.

  Once customers finalize their cart and proceed to checkout, the plugin shows a banner offering them a chance to double their order at a percentage off or for a special price. This option can be highly appealing for consumers looking for a bargain, and it encourages a larger purchase in a way that feels like an exclusive opportunity.

6. **Thank you page Upsells - Displayed at the thank you page**

  Maximize your sales opportunities with our WooCommerce Upsell plugin's "Thank You Page Upsell" feature. After a customer makes a purchase, they're presented with a tailored offer on the 'Thank You' page.

  For instance, buy a blender and instantly get an offer for eco-friendly glass straws at a discount. 

  You can customize the Upsell offer and show relevant products or items from categories based on the items ordered by the customer. You can also offer a percentage or a flat discount on the Upsell products.

7. **Next Order Coupons - Displayed at the thank you page and also sent in the order confirmation emails**

  Boost your sales with our WooCommerce Next Order Coupons feature. After a purchase, generate a unique coupon code for the next purchase and display the coupon code in the Thank you page. Also, you can include the coupon code in the order confirmation email to drive repeat purchases.

  The plugin helps you control the generation of the next order coupon based on minimum / maximum spend, user roles, products purchased and more

8. **Upsell Popups for WooCommerce - Shows Upsell offers in a popup after customers add items to cart & when customers click on the proceed to checkout button**

  Boost your sales effortlessly with our WooCommerce Upsell Popup feature. The moment a customer adds an item to their cart, a popup appears not only confirming the addition but also showcasing targeted upsell product recommendations.

  Here are some examples:
    * Add a smartphone to the cart, and a WooCommerce Upsell Popup suggests compatible phone cases or screen protectors.
    * Buy a coffee maker, and a WooCommerce Upsell Popup recommends specialty coffee beans.

9. **Added to Cart Popup for WooCommerce - Shows Upsell offers in a popup after customers add items to cart**

  Customers can see how many items they have got in the cart and the total so far. Plus, there's a button to view the cart if they are ready to checkout.
  But wait, there's more! Our one-click upsell offers make it a breeze to add recommended products without having to refresh the page. And guess what? Customers will even see how much they are saving with these special deals.

10. **Product Add-on Upsell - Displayed at the product page**

  The "Product Add-ons" feature in WooCommerce stores is a powerful tool for enhancing the shopping experience and increasing sales through upselling. This feature allows store owners to offer additional options and customizations for their products, which customers can select directly from the product page. Options can include things like gift wrapping, custom messages, special finishes, or extended warranties.

  When a customer selects an add-on and press add to cart, it is automatically added to the cart along with the product, providing a clear and transparent cost for the customization.  

  Examples of "Product Add-ons" offers could be:
  * A Gift Wrap add-on

  As customers view their cart, they are presented with a selection of related items or complementary products, encouraging them to make further purchases. These suggestions can be tailored based on the contents of the customer's current cart, past purchasing behavior, or popular products in the store. 

  Examples of "Cart Add-ons" offers could be:
